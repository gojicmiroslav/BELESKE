		JQUERY

Ready function:
	jQuery offers several ways to attach a function that will run when the DOM is ready. All of the following syntaxes are equivalent:
		$( handler )
		$( document ).ready( handler )
		$( "document" ).ready( handler )
		$( "img" ).ready( handler )
		$().ready( handler )

	Examples:
		- $(function(){
				...
			});

		- $.ready(function(){
				...
			});

	There is also $(document).on( "ready", handler ), deprecated as of jQuery 1.8 and removed in jQuery 3.0. Note that if the DOM becomes ready
 	beforethis event is attached, the handler will not be executed.

	The .ready() method is typically used with an anonymous function:
			$( document ).ready(function() {
				// Handler for .ready() called.
			});
	Which is equivalent to the recommended way of calling:
			$(function() {
				// Handler for .ready() called.
			});
