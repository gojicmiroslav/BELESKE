* Console
		- we can specify environment for the console
				bin/rails console staging
				
		- If you wish to test out some code without changing any data(any modification in DB will be rollback), 
			we can do that by invoking: 
				bin/rails console --sandbox.
				
* rails console
		- Inside the rails console you have access to the app and helper instances
		- With the helper method it is possible to access Rails and your application's helpers.
		- Example:
				app.root_path 						#=> '/'
				app.new_user_session_path #=> '/users/sign_in'
				helper.time_ago_in_words 30.days.ago
				helper.my_custom_helper
				
				// performing request to the application
				app.root_path
				app.get _ #=> "_" - result of the previous command
				app.get app.new_user_session_path
				
		- methods on Integration testing can be called on app object
		- More examples:
				app.cookies #=> which cookies are set
				app.response
				app.response.headers
				puts app.response.body
				app.request
				app.request.headers["HTTP_HOST"]
				reload!
				
* Using gems with console(irb)
		- gem install hirb
		- file ~/.irbrc is evaluated when irb console loads. We can put settings there
			(or in ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0 - for RVM)
		-
