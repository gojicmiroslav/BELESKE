RailsCasts:

Dynamic forms:
	ProductType |--> ProductField 


Nested Model Forms:
	Survey |--> Question |--> Answers
	
	- accepts_nested_attributes_for
		Example:
			# in survey.rb
			accepts_nested_attributes_for :questions
			
			# in _form
		
						
RAILS OBSERVER
	- URL: https://github.com/rails/rails-observers
	- This gem contains two observers:
			- Active Record Observer
			- Action Controller Sweeper
	- Active Record Observer - watch for model life-cycle callbacks(before_save, after_save,...) to implement trigger-like behaviour outside the original class
	- Action Controller Sweeper - Sweepers are the terminators of the caching world and responsible for expiring caches when model objects change. 
																They do this by being half-observers, half-filters and implementing callbacks for both roles.		
																
N + 1 Query
	- gem: https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet
	- help to kill N+1 queries and unused eager loading
	- example, Category has many Products
	- on same page shows categories and products for given category
	- # categories_controller/show
			def show
				@categories = Category.order(:name).includes(:products) # eager loading
			end
			
TREES
	- gem 'ancestry'
	
UPGRADING RAILS VERSION
	- make a new branch
			git checkout -b rails4
	- change version of Rails in Gemfile
	- change branch of a gem from github:
			gem 'paper_trail', github: 'airblade/papir_trail', branch: 'rails4'
			
* to_param
	- triggered when Rails needs to represent model in URL
	- it must include id of model, because Rails is doing:
			"1-home".to_i #=> 1
		and use that id of model to find model
