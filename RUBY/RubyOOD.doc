Constructor with Hash parameters:
	def initialize(arr = {})
		@name = arr.fetch(:name, "Default")
	end
	
Inheritance
	- if we want to enforce to child overide parents method, we raise exception in parent method 
		Example:
			class Action
				def some_action
					raise "You must implement this method"
				end
			end
			
			class ChildAction < Action
				def some_action
					...
				end
			end
